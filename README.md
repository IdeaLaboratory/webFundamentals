# javaScript
Developed by Brendan in Netscape in December 4, 1995.
Initially it was named Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally JavaScript
Developed for client side Scripting, in 10 days he made.
Intention was to make easy scripting language for anyone to use.

It was very forgiving language, interpreter proceed with error as well.

In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the Ecma International standards organization to advance the standardization of JavaScript. First edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997.

### DataTypes
Object, number, undefined, undefined, null.

### Type Coercion
a=10; b="10"; a==b is true;

#### Extra:
Define a method, define a class in a old way.
inherit class with properties
Prototype.newMethod()
inherit pro methods

## ES6
#### Scope:
⋅⋅* Global scope
⋅⋅* Function scope
⋅⋅* Block scope

Let, const = Both let and const are block scope.

Code link:

Note: In ES5, we can declare only one variable in a function scope.
If we define two by any chance, JS will not give any error but the last assign value will be retain..
This called "Features of hoisting".

#### Default arguments:

Fun(a,b,c=0)
Code link:

#### Template literals
Syntax
`string text`
This can contain almost anything in between including multiline.

#### Arrow function
```javascript
hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}
```

#### Class
Note: Function vs Method
Function outside of the class and Method inside of a class.

* Cannot over load function, method or constructor.

##### Base constructor is not call by default, we should call super() to call base constructor.
```javascript
class Demo {
    constructor(id, name) {
        console.log("Constructor of Demo");
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
    disp() {
        console.log("Method");
    }
}
class Child extends Demo {
    constructor() {
        super();
        console.log("Const of ChildDemo");
    }
    disp() {
        console.log("Overridden Method");
    }
}
```
